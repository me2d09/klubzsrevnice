My name is Filip. I am a student who moved here from Serbia a couple of years ago and started teaching by chance! Since then, I have visited multiple kindergartens and schools, and have had the pleasure of working with kids from across the country. Teaching has become something of a passion of mine, and I hope I can pass on that energy to the kids as well. My foremost goal in the classroom is to make sure my pupils feel safe and free to explore whatever they like, helping them find their interests and pushing them to explore further. No knowledge can be forced onto someone, languages least of all! My personal interests include martial arts and various other sports, and I never miss a chance to incorporate some of that into my lessons. My time in Řevnice so far has been a blast, and I look forward to all the great experiences to come. See you in the classroom!
