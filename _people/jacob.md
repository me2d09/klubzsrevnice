Hello! My name is Jacob and I come from Wales. I have been teaching for over 5 years now, with Czechia being the 8th country I've taught in! I first arrived in September of 2020 and have actually been partially in the Řevnice area teaching privately, though in the past year I have started working with ZŠ Řevnice in addition to this. I place a big emphasis on active participation and games in my teaching method, as I do believe that at the younger age that kids need to create positive connections with a language in order to inspire them to continue learning later on in life. I am excited for this upcoming year of after school English, looking forward to meeting you all!
