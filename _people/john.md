Hi, my name is John Barker. I am from the other side of the world in New Zealand. I have been living here for 22 years with my Czech wife and 15 year old daughter. I have 12 years teaching experience here in Czech. (In New Zealand I was farming). From 2 – 3 year olds all the way up to adults.
I was teaching in Dobříš, then Sedlčany at the school and now this is my 4th year here in Řevnice.

We have a small horse ranch near Dobříš where we run horse camps and pony club. I also shear sheep around middle Czech. What I like the most about teaching is seeing the improvement in the kids and teaching them English in a fun way, so they enjoy it.
